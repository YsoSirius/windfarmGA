\arguments{
\item{dns}{The data source name (interpretation varies by driver â€” for some
drivers, dsn is a file name, but may also be a folder)}

\item{layer}{The layer name}

\item{Polygon1}{The considered area as SpatialPolygon, SimpleFeature Polygon
or coordinates as matrix/data.frame}

\item{GridMethod}{Should the polygon be divided into rectangular or hexagonal
grid cells? The default is "Rectangular" grid. Hexagonal grids
are computed when assigning "h" or "hexagon" to this input variable.}

\item{Projection}{A spatial reference system. Depending on your PROJ-version,
it should either be a numeric `EPSG-code` or a `Proj4-string`.
Default is \code{EPSG:3035}}

\item{sourceCCL}{The path to the Corine Land Cover raster (.tif). Only
required when the terrain effect model is activated.}

\item{sourceCCLRoughness}{The source to the adapted Corine Land Cover legend
as .csv file. Only required when terrain effect model is activated. As
default a .csv file within this package (\file{~/extdata}) is taken that
was already adapted manually.}

\item{vdirspe}{A data.frame containing the wind speeds, directions and 
probabilities. See \code{\link{windata_format}}.}

\item{Rotor}{The rotor radius in meter}

\item{fcrR}{A numeric value used for grid spacing. Default is \code{5}}

\item{n}{The amount of turbines}

\item{topograp}{Boolean value, which indicates if the terrain effect model
should be enabled or not. Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{iteration}{The number of iterations. Default is \code{20}}

\item{referenceHeight}{The height at which the incoming wind speeds were
measured. Default is \code{RotorHeight}}

\item{RotorHeight}{The height of the turbine hub}

\item{SurfaceRoughness}{A surface roughness length in meters. 
With the terrain effect model, a surface roughness is calculated for every 
grid cell using the elevation and land cover data. Default is \code{0.3}}

\item{Proportionality}{A numeric value used for the grid calculation, as it 
determines the percentage a grid cell must overlay the area. 
Default is \code{1}}

\item{mutr}{A numeric mutation rate. Default is \code{0.008}}

\item{elitism}{Boolean value, which indicates whether elitism should be
activated or not. Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{nelit}{If \code{elitism} is TRUE, this input determines the amount 
of individuals in the elite group. Default is 7}

\item{selstate}{Determines which selection method is used, "FIX" selects a
constant percentage and "VAR" selects a variable percentage, depending on
the development of the fitness values. Default is "FIX"}

\item{crossPart1}{Determines which crossover method is used, "EQU" divides
the genetic code at equal intervals and "RAN" divides the genetic code at
random locations. Default is \code{"EQU"}}

\item{trimForce}{If \code{TRUE} the algorithm will use a probabilistic 
approach to correct the windfarms to the desired amount of turbines. 
If \code{FALSE} the adjustment will be random. Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{weibull}{A boolean value that specifies whether to take Weibull
parameters into account. If \code{TRUE}, the wind speed values 
of \code{vdirspe} are ignored. The algorithm will calculate the mean
wind speed for every wind turbine according to the Weibull parameters.
Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{weibullsrc}{A list of Weibull parameter rasters, where the first list
item must be the shape parameter raster `k` and the second item must be the
scale parameter raster `a` of the Weibull distribution. If no list is given,
then rasters included in the package are used instead, which currently only
cover Austria. This variable is only used if \code{weibull = TRUE}.}

\item{Parallel}{A boolean value, indicating whether parallel processing should
be used. The *parallel* and *doParallel* packages are used for parallel
processing. Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{numCluster}{If \code{Parallel} is TRUE, this variable defines the 
number of clusters to be used. Default is \code{2}}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE it will print information for every generation.
Default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{plotit}{If TRUE it will plot the best windfarm of every generation. 
Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
The result is a matrix with aggregated values per generation; the
  best individual regarding energy and efficiency per generation, some fuzzy
  control variables per generation, a list of all fitness values per
  generation, the amount of individuals after each process, a matrix of all
  energy, efficiency and fitness values per generation, the selection and
  crossover parameters, a matrix with the generational difference in maximum
  and mean energy output, a matrix with the given inputs, a dataframe with
  the wind information, the mutation rate per generation and a matrix with all
  tested wind farm layouts.
}
\description{
The initiating function of an optimization run which will
  interactively check user-inputs. If all inputs are correct, an optimization
  will be started.
}
\details{
A terrain effect model can be included in the optimization process.
  Therefore, a digital elevation model will be downloaded automatically via the
  \code{elevatr::get_elev_raster} function. A land cover raster can also be 
  downloaded automatically from the EEA-website, or the path to a raster file 
  can be passed to \code{sourceCCL}. The algorithm uses an adapted version of the
  Raster legend ("clc_legend.csv"), which is stored in the package directory
  \file{~/inst/extdata}. To use other values for the land cover roughness
  lengths, insert a column named \strong{"Rauhigkeit_z"} to the .csv file,
  assign a surface roughness length to all land cover types. Be sure that all
  rows are filled with numeric values and save the file with \strong{";"}
  separation. Assign the path of the file to the input variable
  \code{sourceCCLRoughness} of this function.
