Title: Genetic Algorithm to optimize a Wind Farm Layout Problem

Description: A genetic algorithm is included, which is designed to optimize small wind farms
    up to 50 turbines. The algorithm works with a fixed amount of turbines, a fixed rotor
    radius and a mean wind speed value for every incoming wind direction.
    If required it can include a terrain effect model, which downloads an SRTM elevation model
    automatically, and loads a Corine Land Cover raster, which has to be downloaded
    previously. Further information can be found at the description of the function "windfarmGA".
    To start an optimization run, either the function "windfarmGA" or "genAlgo" can be used.
    The function "windfarmGA" checks the user inputs interactively and runs then the
    function "genAlgo". If the input parameters are already known, an optimization can be run
    directly via the function "genAlgo". Their output is identical.
