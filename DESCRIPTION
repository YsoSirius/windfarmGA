Description: The genetic algorithm is designed to optimize wind farms of any shape. It requires a predefined amount of turbines, a unified rotor radius and an average wind speed value for each incoming wind direction. A terrain effect model can be included that downloads an 'SRTM' elevation model and loads a Corine Land Cover raster to approximate surface roughness.
